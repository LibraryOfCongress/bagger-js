# bagger-js
### A pure javascript implementation of the Bagit library and application for interacting with that library. Our main goal is to make uploading and bagging files/directories easy and OS agnostic. Specifically it is a way to upload multiple files to a cloud provider (currently Amazon S3), with Strong checking (hashing). 

#### Feature list (checked are features that have been implemented):
* [x] interrupted file transfer continuation
* [x] incremental hashing
* [x] fully async
* [ ] progress bar
* [x] drag and drop of files 
* [ ] drap and drop of directories
* [ ] user authentication
* [ ] bagging content before transfer
